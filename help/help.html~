	    <p>When you enter the tool, an image from the database will be randomly 
          selected and shown. You can help by annotating as many objects as you 
          can. 
	    Note that
	    previously labeled objects may appear on the image.  
	    Please do not label previously labeled objects.
	  Once you have completed the image, you can view a new image 
          by pressing the "show next image" button.</p>

	  <p>The following steps describe how to label an object:</p>

	  <p>
	  1. Start by pressing the left 
          mouse button at some point along the boundary of the object.
	  <br>2. Continue clicking along the boundary of the object
          to create a polygon.
	  <br>3. Once you have finished
          clicking along the boundary of the object click on
          the first point (highlighted).
	  <br>4. A window will now appear asking for the object's
          name.  Enter the object's name and click the "Done" button.
